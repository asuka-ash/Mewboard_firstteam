# File: main.c

- Lot of the setup is similar to client-agent module:
  - Command-Line Argument Handling: The code parses command-line arguments using the getopt function and sets various options accordingly. These options control the behavior of the "monitord" program.
  - Help Statement Function
  - Configuration and Parameter Initialization
  - Configuration Reading
  - SMTP and Email Configuration: The program reads SMTP server and email configuration settings if reports are configured.
  - Worker Node Detection: The program determines if it is running on a worker node in a cluster and adjusts agent monitoring accordingly.
  - Daemon Setup: The program can be run in daemon mode if the -f option is not specified. It performs privilege separation, chroot, and changes user/group to run with appropriate privileges.
  - Signal Handling: The code sets up signal handling for the program.
  - PID File Creation: The code creates a PID file to store the process ID.

- Monitord Execution: The main work of the program is done in the "Monitord()" function, where the core functionality of the "monitord" program is implemented. - monitord.c

# File: monitord.c

- Header Includes: The file includes several header files containing necessary declarations and functions.

- Global Variables: Several global variables are defined, including monitor_config mond, bool worker_node, OSHash* agents_to_alert_hash, and monitor_time_control mond_time_control.

- Monitord() Function: This is the main monitoring loop of the program. It performs various tasks repeatedly in an infinite loop. The key tasks include connecting to the message queue, starting a communication request thread, creating an agents disconnected alert table, initializing time control variables, and performing continuous monitoring operations based on triggers for agents' status, log rotation, report generation, and file management.

- getMonitorInternalOptions(), getMonitorGlobalOptions(), and getReportsOptions() Functions: These functions are used to generate cJSON objects representing different configuration options for monitoring. These options include internal options, global options, and report-related options.

- MonitordConfig() Function: This function is responsible for reading and configuring the monitoring settings from the specified configuration file. It sets various options related to log rotation, monitoring agents, report generation, etc., based on the configuration file.

- monitor_queue_connect() Function: This function connects to the message queue used for communication within the program.

- Time Control Functions: There are several functions related to time control (monitor_init_time_control(), monitor_step_time(), monitor_update_date(), and trigger check functions). These functions manage time-based counters and triggers for different operations.
